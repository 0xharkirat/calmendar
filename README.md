## 🌟 Introduction
Live Site: [calmendar.web.app](https://calmendar.web.app)

I was scrolling through Twitter and came across a beautiful **clean and modern calendar UI design** by [@inkko44](https://x.com/inkko44/status/1889889273190760459). The design really stood out to me with its simplicity and calm aesthetic, so I decided to **recreate it in Flutter**.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

- The original UI design looked minimalistic and elegant.
- I wasn't sure about the exact fonts used, so I decided to use **Inter (Google Fonts)**, which fits the clean and modern look perfectly.
- Added an extra feature: **customizable color themes**, so users can switch between different color schemes.

## 📱 Platforms Supported

- The app is **fully responsive** and works great on **mobile (Android/iOS) and web**.
- Currently, it is **only deployed for web**, as the goal of this project is to **showcase my Flutter UI and design skills** rather than build a production-ready app.
